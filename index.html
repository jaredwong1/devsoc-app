                Hello there! I am Jared, welcome to my website! Unfortunately as 
                I am sure you can tell I am very new to coding websites, and tried 
                my best to create something with the basics of HTML and CSS. I 
                (very poorly) tried to create an Earth-y vibe to fit the theme.
                Although this isn't the greatest website ever perhaps frame it as 
                my dedication and willingness to learn new things (pls).

            <div>
                Currently I am 18 years old and going into my 2nd year of uni. I'm 
                here at UNSW studying actuarial studies and computer science 
                (but I'm lowkey thinking about dropping actuarial).   
            </div>
            <div>
                As I'm not very far into my degree yet, I've only completed: 
                COMP1511, COMP1521, and COMP2521. However, these courses have underpinned
                a newfound passion for coding, and I am extremely dedicated to 
                learning anything required as a trainee!

            <div>Ok here's the fun part.</div>
            <div class="hobbie-headings">Sports</div>
            <div>
                Ever since I've been 4 years old I have played soccer. Every year 
                I play in a team and then play summer soccer once the season ends. 
                I feel like it's the sport that everyone gets put in when they're
                young, but it happened to stick with me to this day. 
            </div>
            <div>
                Alternatively, this summer I've been playing a
                lot of golf, tennis and going surfing which has been insanely fun.
                I love being out in the sun and being around friends which these 
                are great for.

            <div class="hobbie-headings">Reading</div>
            <div> 
                Towards the end of high school I began reading for something
                to do on public transport and to get me away from screens. I love
                the vibe when walking into a bookstore and the overwhelming amount 
                of books available. Recently I read The Book Thief and 1984, 
                both I found extremely interesting, and would recommend.

            <div class="hobbie-headings">Guitar</div>
            <div> 
                The past few years I discovered a love for older rock music 
                which prompted me to want to learn how to play a guitar. When 
                I was younger I used to play a little piano but never got 
                any good. Although I'm still terrible it has been really 
                fun playing some of my favourite songs.
